#Test 1

Write a function:

```function solution(A);```

That, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum among all integers which are multiples of 3.

For example, given array A as follows:

[-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]

The function should return 1011

Assume that:

- N is an integer within the range [1..1, 000];

- Each element of array A is an integer with the range [-10,000..10,000]

- There is at least one element in array A which satisfies the condition in the task statement.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
